A few small updates over the last few days:

## Spawn Points

When collecting spawn points via the Spawn Grid, the system would process a coordinate multiple times. 

Added memoization to prevent processing a coordinate multiple times.

## Spawn in Buildings

This broke due to prematurely adding the entity's coordinate into memoization... So... not doing that fixed it.
