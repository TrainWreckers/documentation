## GM Release: 0.1.44

Fixed `EnableTypeDiscriminator`. Reforger 1.6 added a boolean argument. So we're passing in `true` now.

## Spawn System Release: 0.1.42

When iterating over vehicles from the `EntityCatalog`, we were spawning vehicles simply to determine the size of
them. Not only was this something we weren't using (yet), but turns out a few mods pertaining to vehicles have 
a typo in their user actions causing things to break.

Since we're not using the size of vehicles, we removed this call. Also believe there is a better way to accomplish
something similar.
